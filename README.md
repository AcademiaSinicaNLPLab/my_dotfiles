# One Operation Installation Dotfiles

Contents:
* .nvimrc
* .zshrc
* .gitconfig
* .tmux.conf

## Philosophy
* One operation installation. Simply run
```bash
$ ./setup.sh # everything is done

```

* No framework (particularly, oh-my-zsh). Control everything yourself.

* One setting one file. Every setting file should work well itself.
    * Use package manager for [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) and zsh


## Neovim

### Work Flow
Everyone (should) has his/her own work flow. My nvimrc fits best for my own.

#### Principles
1. Use neovim as tmux (unless you want to run program on remote servers after you log off.)
2. Use tab (:tabedit) instead of window.
3. The only time to split a new window is when you want to open a terminal (:term)

#### Moving Around
1. Tab is used intensively. So tab switching deserves a hotkey
    * `Ctrl+h`, `Ctrl+l` to move to the left or right tab
    * `Ctrl+Alt+h`, `Ctrl+Alt+l` to move current tab to left or right
2. Never leave your hjkl
    * Exit commandmode, insertmode, terminalmode, back to normal mode using `jk` (use `Enter` for visual mode instead)
    * `Alt+h`, `Alt+l` to move to line begin or line end (this also work for visual mode, and my zshrc also has binding to make this work for terminalmode)
    * `ctrl+j`, `ctrl+k` to move to the next or previous blank line (the same in visual mode)
    * `ctrl+j`, `ctrl+k` bind to <Down> or <Up> in commandmode and terminalmode

#### Terminal mode
* `Alt+e`, `Alt+o`, `Alt+t` to open new shell in vertical window, horizontal window, or a new tab
* Exit terminal mode and switch to other window with `Ctrl+a` (bind to vim's `Ctrl+w`)

#### Folding
* `<Space>` to unfold
* `<Space>` to open directory in nerdtree

#### Workflow
1. Open neovim with nerdtree
```bash
$ nvim .
```
2. Open file from nerdtree in new tab with `t` key
3. Unfold directory in nerdtree with `<Space>`
4. In nerdtree, change working directory by moving cursor to the directory and press `<Enter>` (usually, I will then open a vertical shell and then do something in the working directory)
3. Working directory automatically changes when you switch between tabs
4. To execute shell commands, enter terminal mode in a a vertical split window with `Alt+e`
5. To have two shells in a tab, split a new horizontal shell with `Alt+o`
6. Have a shell in a new tab with `Alt+t`
